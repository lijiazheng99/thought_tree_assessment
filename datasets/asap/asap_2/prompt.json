    "question": "[Question]:\nA student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability.\nProcedure:\n1. Take a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length.\n2. Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it is hanging freely down the side of the table.\n3. Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.\n4. Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.\n5. Remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types.\n6. Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.\n7. Perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1).\nThe student recorded the following data from the investigation.\nData Table:\n| Plastic Type | Amount Stretched T1 (mm) | Amount Stretched T2 (mm) |\n| A | 10 | 12 |\n| B | 22 | 23 |\n| C | 14 | 13 |\n| D | 20 | 20 |\n a. Draw a conclusion based on the studentâ€™s data.\nb. Describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results.",
    "key_elements_original": "[Key Answer Elements]:\nExperimental Design Improvements:\nProvide the before and after measurements for length (Did the samples all start out the same size?).\nMake sure the samples are all of the same thickness. Variations in thickness could have caused variations in stretchability.\nPerform additional trials. Some of the samples have similar stretchability (A and C, B and D). Two trials may not be enough to conclusively state that one is more stretchable than the other.\nIndicate how many weights were added to the clamps (Was it the same number for each sample?).\nConclusions:\nPlastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics.\nPlastic sample A has the least amount of stretchability compared to the other polymer plastics.\nNot all polymer plastics have the same stretchability.\nDifferent polymer plastics have different stretchability (and are therefore suited for different applications).\nA reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors.",
