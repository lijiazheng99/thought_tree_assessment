This takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzyme.The third type is osmosis.

When a cell has to use active transport, it has to do something to let the object, or liquid, into the cell.  It has to use channel proteins to allow it in.

{"Id":16339,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"THE CELL ALOWS THINGS TO COME IN AND OUT THE CELL"}
{"Id":16340,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"The cell brings in nutreints through the cell membrane. Then the nutrients move across the golgi bodies and out the other side."}
{"Id":16341,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"Energy is stored and than released when necessary to obtain and give off energy for movement."}
{"Id":16342,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"spores open up and force movement out of the membrane"}
{"Id":16343,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":1,"Response":"The three processes used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cells are diffusion, osmosis, and something else. Osmosis is the diffusion of water from high to low."}
{"Id":16344,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"They send signals.They control your body movement.They make sure your body is working properly."}
{"Id":16345,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"The cell's control center, the nucleus tells the cell where things need to go. The vacule controls what enters and leaves the cell."}
{"Id":16346,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"MitosisOsmosisMiosis"}
{"Id":16347,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"parts of the cell"}
{"Id":16348,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"Movement across the cell- membrane is controlled through ..."}
{"Id":16349,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":1,"Response":"Osmosis- Diffusion of water across a cell membrane."}
{"Id":16350,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"The cell membrane uses diffusion, osmosis, and chemiosis to move substances across the cell membrane."}
{"Id":16351,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"interphasemetaphase prophase"}
{"Id":16352,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"sodium-potassium pump, ion channel, and lipid bilayer"}
{"Id":16353,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":1,"Response":"Osmosis- water is transfered through thte cell from less concentrated to more concentrated. Diffusion- many substances are transfered to and from the cell through the cell membrane.Symbiosis-"}
{"Id":16354,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"Of these three processes, one is using pores on the membrane itself to transfer protiens, another way is through absorbing the substances threw the membrane into the cell, the last way is that the membrane allows the substance to enter the cell."}
