    "key_elements_original": "[Key Answer Elements]:\nSelective Permeability: The cell membrane selectively allows certain substances to pass through, controlling the internal environment.\nPassive Transport: This process involves substances moving from areas of higher to lower concentration without using energy, including simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion (where membrane proteins assist in the movement).\nOsmosis: A specific type of passive transport where water moves across the cell membrane from areas of low solute concentration to areas of high solute concentration.\nActive Transport: This energy-dependent process moves substances against their concentration gradient, from lower to higher concentration areas, using transport proteins like pumps.\nProtein Channels and Carrier Proteins: These structures in the cell membrane facilitate the transport of ions and other molecules, essential in processes like facilitated diffusion and active transport.\nMembrane-assisted Transport: This includes mechanisms like exocytosis and endocytosis, where vesicles transport large molecules in and out of the cell, and phagocytosis and pinocytosis for engulfing particulates and fluids, respectively.",
