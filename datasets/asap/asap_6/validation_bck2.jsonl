{"Id":14417,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"1.they gather protin from out side.2.they keep moving from one place to another.3.it all process the membrane."}
{"Id":14438,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":0,"Response":"1.) When an emzyne csuch as insulin attaches to a cell it tells the cell to let in sugar.2.) equalibrum is when one side has more of a protien then the other so they transfer the protiens over untill they are equal.3.)When a protien fits into a channel protien to make it change shape for a bigger protien to come through."}
{"Id":14488,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":1,"Response":"One of them is that the cell membrane is selectivley permeable. The cell membrane controlls what enters and exits the cell.  The nucleus tells the cell what to do because it acts as a brain."}
{"Id":14637,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":1,"Response":"Osmosis is a process used by cells to move water across the cell membrane. A sodium-potassium pump is a process used by cells to move sodium and potassium up the cell's concentration gradiant. In turn, the concentration gradient moves things from higher to lower concentrations across the cell membrane."}
{"Id":14484,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":2,"Response":"Three processes used by cells are diffusion, which is the movement of molecules over a selectively permeable membrane, osmosis, which involves water being passed over the membrane, and active diffusion, which requires energy from the cell to move particles through the membrane."}
{"Id":14455,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":2,"Response":"One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP.  ATP is active transport where the substances latch on to receptor proteins and then are able to get inside the cell.Another type of movement to allow substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.  These substances move from high concentration to low concentration.  Therefore, substances are able to move into the cell or outside of it through diffusion.A third process used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane is thier protein channels.  The protein channels allow certain things to come through."}
{"Id":14439,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":3,"Response":"Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient."}
{"Id":15254,"EssaySet":6,"Mark":3,"Response":"cells use endocytosis, exocytosis and osmosis to move between membranes     In endocytosis, material is encased and becomes part of a cell. in exocytosis the cell encases things inside of itself and sends them out.in osmosis, water is difused and material travels through the membrane"}
