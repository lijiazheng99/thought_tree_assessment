{"Id":13340,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"In protein synthesis after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the cell will need to make a copy of the mRNA. After copying it, it will be synthized. Then, the copied version and the original version will be crossed over to cause genetic variation for the organism. Last, the cell will be sent out to the body to replace the ones that can no longer do thier job efficiently."}
{"Id":13341,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"Four major steps would be prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase."}
{"Id":13342,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"The nucleus leaves the body."}
{"Id":13343,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":1,"Response":"when mRNA leaves the nucleus the ribosomes take it to the golgi apparatus.Then, from there it goes to the mitochondria and then the nucleus"}
{"Id":13344,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"annaphase prophase metaphase telephase"}
{"Id":13345,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"The first step is the mRNA is unzipped by a RNA polymerase. Then it is made into tRNA. After that it enters our DNA and lastly it is made into protein."}
{"Id":13346,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"htey are manufacture and produced and used trhen excreated from the nucleus"}
{"Id":13347,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"Well after the RNA leaves the nucleus it makes a sectiond strand that maches form the strand that it made to go with the DNA. It then turns in to TRNA witch turn the T bace in to a U bace and the U bace pears up with the A bace. Then they canect with the RRAN to make the ameno acideds."}
{"Id":13348,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein."}
{"Id":13349,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"mrna leaves the nucleus"}
{"Id":13350,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"mRNA leaves the nucleus first, second they get the ATP and they take it to the mitochondria and they let them know what they have to fix, fourth they go to the place where the cell needs fixed, and fifth they end up with protein synthesis."}
{"Id":13351,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":1,"Response":"The mRNA leaves the nucleus. The mRNA takes a code to a ribosome. The amino acids in the ribosome translates the code and attaches a responds to the tRNA. The tRNA goes back to the nucleus with with its coded segments."}
{"Id":13352,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"mRNA enters the cytoplasm. It then carries instructions to the ammino acid sequence. Then it turns into tRNA and carries the complete sequence off. From there it creates a protien."}
{"Id":13353,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"protein's gather together.proteins attach to each other.in order to attempt to repair the nucleus.proteins go to the nucleus."}
{"Id":13354,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"-The mRNA can leave the cell. -The cell will take in sugars. -They will be converted into energy. -They will be used as energy for the cell."}
{"Id":13355,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are when the DNA is being replicated, when rRNA is being produced, when tRNA is being produced and when mRNA is being changed."}
{"Id":13356,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"first you go to prophase then from prophase you go to metaphase from metaphase you go to anaphase from anaphase you go to telephase during all these steps you start offf with two cell then you have the cells seprating into two seprate one then they just end as being one cell"}
{"Id":13357,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"It gets rid of the nuleus."}
{"Id":13358,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"prophase, metaphase,interphase, anaphase"}
{"Id":13359,"EssaySet":5,"Mark":0,"Response":"nuclitide. mitocondri. fagella. goli apperatuce."}
