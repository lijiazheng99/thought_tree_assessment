In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure."}
{"Id":929,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples.

{"Id":999,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity."}
{"Id":1002,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end."}
{"Id":1004,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves."}

{"Id":1598,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment."}
{"Id":1601,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them."}
{"Id":1613,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants."}
{"Id":1620,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass."}
{"Id":1625,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen."}
{"Id":1630,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours."}
{"Id":1642,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled."}
{"Id":1650,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment."}
{"Id":1655,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors."}
{"Id":1658,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample."}
{"Id":1659,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers."}
{"Id":1661,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc)."}
{"Id":1662,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment."}
{"Id":1668,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar."}
{"Id":1671,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples.  marbles, limestone, wood, plastic.  What kind of containers?  If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass."}
