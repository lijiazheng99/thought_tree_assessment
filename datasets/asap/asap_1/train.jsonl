{"Id":1075,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers."}
{"Id":1076,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word\"samples\" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."}
{"Id":1077,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes.

{"Id":1636,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations."}
{"Id":1637,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to."}
{"Id":1638,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample.

{"Id":1646,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer."}
{"Id":1647,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified."}
{"Id":1648,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic.

Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis\/conclusion."}
{"Id":1649,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified."}
{"Id":1651,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour."}
{"Id":1652,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out)."}
{"Id":1653,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass."}
{"Id":1654,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses."}
{"Id":1656,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"Determine the mass of four different samples."}
{"Id":1657,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)"}
{"Id":1660,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours."}
{"Id":1663,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate."}
{"Id":1664,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":3,"Response":"In order to replicate the \"acid rain\" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"}
{"Id":1665,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties."}
{"Id":1666,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment."}
{"Id":1667,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":2,"Response":"One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square."}
{"Id":1669,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass."}
{"Id":1670,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":0,"Response":"To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample."}
{"Id":1672,"EssaySet":1,"Mark":1,"Response":"In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment."}
