    "question": "[Question]:\nA group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation.\nProcedure:\n1.Determine the mass of four different samples.\n2.Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical, containers.\n3.Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container.\n4.After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.\n5.Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.\n6.Determine the mass of each sample.\nThe students's data are recorded in the table below.\n|Sample|Starting Mass (g)|Ending Mass (g)|Difference in Mass (g)|\n| Marble | 9.8 | 9.4 | -0.4 |\n| Limestone | 10.4 | 9.1 | -1.3 |\n| Wood | 11.2 | 11.2 | 0.0 |\n| Plastic | 7.2 | 7.1 | -0.1 |\nAfter reading the group's procedure, describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment.\nMake sure to include at least three pieces of information.",
